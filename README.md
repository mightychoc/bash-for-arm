# bash for ARM64

This repo uses a GitHub workflow to weekly pull the latest source code of bash and statically compile it for ARM64/AArch64. You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/mightychoc/bash-for-arm/releases/latest). A new build is issued every Monday shortly after midnight.
